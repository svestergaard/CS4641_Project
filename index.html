    <h2>Methods</h2> 
    <p>For this project, a dimensionality reduction method must first be used to determine what features from the many available to us are most important in terms of predicting future wins.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to find the features that explain the most variance in the target variable so that a more efficient model can be made afterwards.
    Ridge Regression is our initial choice for the supervised model that will predict the amount of wins a quarterback will get in a future season.
    A Regression model will predict an actual integer value for our target variable unlike a classification algorithm, which is what we want in terms of predicting future wins.
    We also do not want sharp fluctuations in our predicted output, and using Ridge Regression will help optimize the complexity of the model to ensure a smoother fit.</p>
