            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>The primary goal of our project is to predict the future winrate of NFL quarterbacks based on their performance numbers from previous seasons. We selected the QB position because it is widely considered the position which has the single largest impact on team performance, and is also the position for which data is most readily available. The aim of this project is to produce an improved model for quantifying a QB's future value, which would allow NFL teams to make better decisions in roster construction. Current methods for projecting QB performance still rely heavily on traditional methods, such as scouting, which is subjective and prone to bias, so we believe such a model would provide valuable information in this regard. The dataset we will use originates from Pro-Football-Reference.com, and consists of QB counting stats such as touchdowns, interceptions, yardage, and much more for the past ~20 seasons.

            <h2>Methods</h2> 
            <p>For this project, a dimensionality reduction method must first be used to determine what features from the many available to us are most important in terms of predicting future wins.
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to find the features that explain the most variance in the target variable so that a more efficient model can be made afterwards. In this way, 
            less necessary features such as uniform number can be eliminated to allow better focus on relevant features. Ridge Regression is our initial choice for the supervised model that will 
            predict the amount of wins a quarterback will get in a future season. A regression model will predict an actual integer value for our target variable unlike a classification algorithm, 
            which is what we want in terms of predicting future wins. We also do not want sharp fluctuations in our predicted output, and using Ridge Regression will help optimize the complexity of 
            the model to ensure a smoother fit. To compare this result to other methods, we also plan to use a neural network which should perform better at solving the interactions between input variables.

            <h2>Results</h2> 
            <p>Our hope is that our model provides a fairly accurate means of predicting quarterback performance in the long term. Currently, most quarterback analysis done through traditional scouting 
            and statistical analysis. Furthermore, most of our research into other machine learning models of this type looked only at single season performance for quarterbacks. We want to project a 
            player's performance over the course of multiple seasons to give a better indication of long-term value and ideal contracting for any player.

            <h2>Discussion</h2> 
            <p>The best possible outcome for our model is that it predicts long-term performance of NFL quarterbacks with high accuracy. If the model is able to surpass traditional scouting and 
            analysis methods, it could provide a new means of determining which players are worthy of investment. Machine analysis of player performance as far back as college games could provide 
            a much simpler means of drafting. If the model is able to perform well, a logical next step would be to expand the model to include other positions. Obviously, the features would be much
            different for each position, but it is not outside the realm of possibility of training the model on other features for the purpose of analyzing the performance of all NFL players.
