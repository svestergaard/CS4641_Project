  <h1>Project Name</h1>

  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>The primary goal of our project is to predict the future winrate of NFL quarterbacks based on their performance numbers from previous seasons. We selected the QB position because
      it is widely considered the position which has the single largest impact on team performance, and is also the position for which data is most readily available. The aim of this project
      is to produce an improved model for quantifying a QB's future value, which would allow NFL teams to make better decisions in roster construction. Current methods for projecting QB performance 
      still rely heavily on traditional methods, such as scouting, which is subjective and prone to bias, so we believe such a model would provide valuable information in this regard. 
      The dataset we will use originates from Pro-Football-Reference.com, and consists of QB counting stats such as touchdowns, interceptions, yardage, and much more for the past ~20 seasons.

    <h2>Methods</h2> 
    <p>For this project, a dimensionality reduction method must first be used to determine what features from the many available to us are most important in terms of predicting future wins.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to find the features that explain the most variance in the target variable so that a more efficient model can be made afterwards.
    Ridge Regression is our initial choice for the supervised model that will predict the amount of wins a quarterback will get in a future season.
    A Regression model will predict an actual integer value for our target variable unlike a classification algorithm, which is what we want in terms of predicting future wins.
    We also do not want sharp fluctuations in our predicted output, and using Ridge Regression will help optimize the complexity of the model to ensure a smoother fit.</p>
